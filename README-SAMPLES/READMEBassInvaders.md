## Usage

Bass Invaders is an application that allows users utilize the power of AI to generate a playlist. Sometimes we get stuck in a funk and need a pump up song to pull us out, sometimes we need something meditative after a long day of stressful debugging. We created Bass Invaders to alleviate the stress and time it takes to find that perfect tune - just leave that in our hands.
