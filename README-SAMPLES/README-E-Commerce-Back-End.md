## Installation

Ensure that <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a> is installed, clone this code from within my repository, and use npm i to download all necessary dependencies and packages. Update the .env file with your username and password, and then run the command line command npm start.



## Usage

Once you have ran the npm start command, you will recieve a "server listening on port 3001" notification. Using insomnia, test those routes by entering the URL, such as: 
http://localhost:3001/api/products
http://localhost:3001/api/categories
http://localhost:3001/api/tags
